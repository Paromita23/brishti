# Workshop material - **Day #1** - AWS CodeCommit/Visual Studio (VS) Code
 
 **Setting up AWS CodeCommit**
   * Open: https://635681506020.signin.aws.amazon.com/console in your browser; bookmark this page in your browser
   * Type your IAMS user name as  {hexaware e-mail Id}-Hexaware, e.g, KrishnaKumar-Hexaware  and "hexaware123" as your initial sign-in password
   * After  you sign in for the first time, you must change your password.
    
  **Setting Up the Public and Private Keys for Git and AWS CodeCommit**
    * Step 1: Open the Git Bash emulator; From the emulator, run the ssh-keygen command, and follow the directions to save the file to the .ssh directory for your profile.
    * For example:
      * $ `ssh-keygen`
    * Generating public/private rsa key pair.
    * Enter file in which to save the key (/drive/Users/user-name/.ssh/id_rsa): Pree Enter [to save the key in C:\users\Hvuser\.ssh\id_rsa) 
    * Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): Pree Enter [do not use passphrase]
    * Enter same passphrase again: Press Enter 
    * Your identification has been saved in drive/Users/user-name/.ssh/id_rsa.
    * Your public key has been saved in drive/Users/user-name/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
    * The key fingerprint is:
       * 45:63:d5:99:0e:99:73:50:5e:d4:b3:2d:86:4a:2c:14 user-name@client-name
    * The key's randomart image is:
    ```
+--[ RSA 2048]----+
|        E.+.o*.++|
|        .o .=.=o.|
|       . ..  *. +|
|        ..o . +..|
|        So . . . |
|          .      |
|                 |
|                 |
|                 |
+-----------------+
    ```
    * This generates:
        •	The id_rsa file, which is the private key file.
        •	The id_rsa.pub file, which is the public key file.
   
    * Step 2: Run the following commands to display the value of the public key file (id_rsa.pub)
        `cd .ssh`
        `notepad id_rsa.pub`
    * Copy the contents of the file, and then close Notepad without saving. The contents of the file will look similar to the following:
    ```
    ssh-rsa EXAMPLE-AfICCQD6m7oRw0uXOjANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQUFADCBiDELMAkGA1UEBhMCVVMxCzAJB
    gNVBAgTAldBMRAwDgYDVQQHEwdTZWF0dGxlMQ8wDQYDVQQKEwZBbWF6b24xFDASBgNVBAsTC0lBTSBDb2
    5zb2xlMRIwEAYDVQQDEwlUZXN0Q2lsYWMxHzAdBgkqhkiG9w0BCQEWEG5vb25lQGFtYXpvbi5jb20wHhc

    DgYDVQQHEwdTZWF0dGxlMQ8wDQYDVQQKEwZBbWF6b24xFDAS=EXAMPLE user-name@computer-name
    ```
    * Step 3: Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/.
    
    * Step 4: In the IAM console, in the navigation pane, choose Users, and from the list of users, choose your IAM user
    
    * Step 5: On the user details page, choose the Security Credentials tab, and then choose Upload SSH public key.
    
    * Step 6: Paste the contents of your SSH public key into the field, and then choose Upload SSH public key
    
    * Step 7: Copy or save the information in SSH Key ID (for example, APKAEIBAERJR2EXAMPLE).
    
    * Step 8: In the Bash emulator, type the following commands to create a config file in the ~/.ssh directory, or edit it if one already exists:
        `cd .. [if you are in .ssh directory already]`
        `vi ~/.ssh/config`
    * Step 9: Add the following lines to the file, where the value for User is the SSH key ID you copied earlier, and the value for 
    [User shift+ p to copy the following lines in vi editor]
    ```
Host git-codecommit.*.amazonaws.com
User APKAEIBAERJR2EXAMPLE   [user i(insertmode)to edit the user id]
IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
    ```
      * Use :wq to save the file 
      
    * Step 10: Run the following command to test your SSH configuration:
     * `ssh git-codecommit.us-east-2.amazonaws.com`
     * You will be asked to confirm the connection because git-codecommit.us-east-2.amazonaws.com is not yet included in your known hosts file. 
     * The AWS CodeCommit server fingerprint is displayed as part of the verification (a9:6d:03:ed:08:42:21:be:06:e1:e0:2a:d1:75:31:5e for MD5 or 
     *                                                                                   3lBlW2g5xn/NA2Ck6dyeJIrQOWvn7n8UEs56fG6ZIzQ for SHA256).
  * Command Line/Gitbash --  Open Gitbash
    * `pwd` -- Check and verify that the current working directory is C:\users\Hvuser
    * `cd workspace` -- change current working to workspace
    * `pwd` -- Check and verify that the current working directory is C:\users\Hvuser/workspace
        
  * Git (setup/checkout/clone/pull/push)
    * `git --version` // should be atleast 2.14+
    * `git config --global -l` // should throw an error
    * `git config --global user.name "<your name>"`
    * `git config --global user.email <your email>`
    * `git config --global -l`

  ** Clone repository at Gitbash **
    * Open https://console.aws.amazon.com/codecommit
    * Use the following URL to access your repository
    * https://us-east-2.console.aws.amazon.com/codesuite/codecommit/repositories/MLP178/browse?region=us-east-2#
    * Choose Clone URL, and then copy the SSH URL.    
    * Go back to Gitbash and clone the project
    * `pwd` -- Check and verify that the current working directory is C:\users\Hvuser/workspace
    * `git clone ssh://git-codecommit.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/v1/repos/MLP178 `
    * `cd MLP178`
    * `git status`
  * open Visual Studio (VS) Code
    * Open folder c:\users\Hvuser\workspace\MLP178
    * Browse the directories to understand the repository structure

# Workshop material - Day #2 - MySQL Workbench/Cli/Curl/Browser to interact w/ application

  * Open MySQL Workbench
  * Open the localhost connection
    * Mac OS: `export PATH=$PATH:/Applications/MySQLWorkbench.app/Contents/MacOS` and then you can use the command line `mysql -u root -phexawareftpdev`
  * `CREATE DATABASE MLP178;` and click the lightning button
  * `CREATE USER 'MLP178'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'MLP178';`
  * `GRANT ALL ON MLP178.* TO 'MLP178'@'localhost';`
  * Open database/database.ddl in VS code
  * Copy the entire contents to MySQL Workbench
  * Execute the ddl 
  * Click the table icon against the MENU table in the right-hand side schemas section
  * Open database/database.dml in VS code
  * Copy the contents to MySQL Workbench
  * Execute the dml 
  * Click the table icon against the MENU table in the right-hand side schemas section. You should see the data just inserted.
  * Play around with
    * SELECT with predicates
    * UPDATE statements with predicates
    * DELETE statements with predicates
    * At the end of all the playing around, leave the database with 5 records with ids (101,102..
    
  * Next, we will build and run the java code
  * go to gitbash, ensure you are in workspace/MLP178
  * `cd restservice/canteenmanagement`
  * `mvn compile`
  * `mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=com.hexaware.MLP178.util.CliMain`
    * As expected, the cli displays only the food id for the MENU; we need to do some code changes before the other attributes 
    * such as name will start appearing in the cli. But before that we will test the application as a REST service.
    * Due to a bug in the database connection code, after exiting, there will be an error with a stack trace. Ignore this error.
  * Build the war file as follows:
    * `mvn package` -- This build a war (java web archive with the code for the REST service)
    * `cp target/MLP178-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.war /D/FTP/apache-tomcat-8.5.16-windows-x64/apache-tomcat-8.5.16/webapps/MLP178.war`
    * start tomcat and tail its logs
      * `cd D/FTP/apache-tomcat-8.5.16-windows-x64/apache-tomcat-8.5.16`
      * `rm -rf logs/*`
      * `./bin/startup.sh`
      * `tail -f logs/*`
      * `curl -vvv http://localhost:8080/MLP178/api/menu`
      * `cd ../../webui/lmApp/`
   * `npm install`
   * `ng serve`
   * Notice that the tail terminal shows that the new version of the web application archive is now getting deployed
   * Open Chrome browser and navigate to http://localhost:4200
   * You should be able to see the Menu ids, food names and vendor ids  as you have entered them in the local mysql database

# Workshop material - Day #3 - Git workflow

In this workshop, we will get familiar with

  * The git development cycle - see CHEATSHEET.md, git/development cycle
  * Branching, Reviewing, Merging
  * Resolving conflicts
  
We will learn to this by playing tic-tac-toe within each group. Play as many rounds as needed to get the hang of how we use git for branching and merging, by letting different members play different roles in each round.

In this, let's use TTT-99 for the Trello Project Board Ticket number which is needed for branch naming.

## Playing without conflicts

Split the group into two teams of two each and one reviewer, say team-X and team-O. Choose who goes first, perhaps by coin toss.

In this, team-X use one desktop in a shared manner and play 'X's while team-O share another desktop and play 'O's.

The team that goes first follows the git process to checkout and change tictactoe.html to add 'X' or 'O' in a cell. The reviewer
merges the change - after verifying that the game is not over and the team has added only one cell.

Then the second team plays in a similar manner. This continues until the reviewer decides that the game has been won, or is a draw.

The reviewer then cleans up tictactoe.html. One of the others review and merge this change.

Play as many rounds as needed till everyone is comfortable with git operations. The git commands should become 'muscle' memory - the ability to run these commands without referring to the cheatsheet.

## Playing with conflicts

Here, the team members play their turns individually on their desktops; say team-X has two members X1 and X2. Both start their turns simultaneously, by pulling master and checking out branches.

The reviewer will merge one, but the second pull request can not be auto-merged. So the player who goes second needs to resolve the conflict. S/he looks at the change as made by the first player and her own change and chooses the better of the two. If hers is better, this is another pull request for the reviewer to merge.

Play as many rounds as needed till everyone is comfortable with git conflict resolution.
