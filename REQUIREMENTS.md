   * Shows personal and Wallet details.
   * Customer can order food.
   * The order will be accepted only,when the customer had enough money for the ordered food in

  * "Back to Menu" takes the customer back to the Menu list screen from all the screen.
  * Entering the "Vendor Admin Login” button in the Home screen will take to the Food Vendor login. 

# Must-Have
